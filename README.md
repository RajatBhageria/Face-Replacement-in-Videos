# Face-Replacement-in-Videos

You need the following packages:
* cv2 (OpenCV)
* numpy
* dlib
* skvideo.io (pip install sk-video)
* matplotlib.pyplot
* scipy.spatial.Delaunay

To run, simply put in the file paths for the two videos into test.py (our code only handles one face per video).

In console you should see which frame the algorithm is analyzing.
